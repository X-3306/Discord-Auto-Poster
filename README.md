# Discord-Auto-Poster
An automatic Discord bot that periodically sends text (.txt) and PDF (.pdf) files to a designated channel. Perfect for sharing articles, documents, or other content at regular intervals. The bot handles the sending schedule and informs the owner of any errors. Configured using a .env file.

## Currently the bot only supports .txt and .pdf files.

### The file sending schedule is defined in lines 43-50 of main.py
